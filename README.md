# Morgana
A data visualisation tool to inspect complex datasets.

## HealthHack Melbourne 2016 Project Brief

Researchers working in clinical studies collect a lot of patient samples, laboratory and clinical data, and these are often collected independently of each other.

A major challenge is to easily see what data we have on whom. For example, we might have genetic data on 15% of our cohort, epigenetic measures on 35%, we will have collected flow cytometry data on 60% and serology on 100% of the cohort.
 
How can we aim to curb life-threatening diseases when the laboratory data we collect is not even remotely connected to clinical outcomes, and specimen data?

How can data stored in different incompatible systems be of any use to solving a research question?

There’s a severe need for an intuitive and interactive way to visualize relationships between different types of data collected in clinical studies.
 
We need to be able to examine this data in a myriad of scales and contexts, from a bird's eye view through to specific subgroups containing a half dozen specimens can inform this critical stage of research. 

This project from the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute will utilize actual data from one of the worlds leading cohorts of paediatric food allergy, to develop a flexible, intuitive, visual solution to research data management.

Ideally, the solution would consist of an easily queried database (preferably SQL-based), providing data to a web frontend. Several excellent libraries exist for this purpose (e.g. d3.js, [plot.ly][4]), though as is to be expected, the devil is in the details - gluing the various components together into a cohesive, user-friendly whole is the real challenge for this project.

If you think you can help us develop this tool, you’ll be working on a project that will make research teams more effective in combating life-threatening disease.


## Etymology of name

Named after the Arthurian sorceress Morgan le Fay, Fata Morgana or Morgana. Morgana is believed to have conjured the images of distant land or floating castles often seen in the Straits of Messina to lure unsuspecting sailors to their death. 

Fata Morgana is an unusual and complex form of mirage where an object is significantly distorted and rapidly changes. The mirage  can comprise of several inverted (upside down) and erect (right side up) that are stacked on top of one another.
